Description: The main function is icweib, which fits a stratified Weibull proportional hazards model for left censored, right censored, interval censored, and non-censored survival data. We parameterize the Weibull regression model so that it allows a stratum-specific baseline hazard function, but where the effects of other covariates are assumed to be constant across strata. Now allows for optional case weights.
