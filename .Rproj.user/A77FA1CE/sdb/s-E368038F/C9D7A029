However, the model assumes that the regression coefficients for all other explanatory variables (excluding the stratum indicator) are constant across strata.  Assuming a Weibull distribution for the random variable corresponding to the time to event in conjunction with the Cox proportional hazards model, the survival function can be expressed as S(t | Z) = exp(-lambda*exp(beta*Z)*t^(gamma)), where Z denotes the vector of covariates, gamma denotes the shape parameter and lambda the scale parameter.  To allow stratum-specific baseline hazard functions, we generalize the model given above by  expressing the survival function as S(t | Z, Stratum=i) = exp(-lambda_i*exp(beta*Z)*t^(gamma_i)), where i denotes the stratum, Z denotes the vector of covariates, gamma_i and lambda_i denote the shape and scale parameters for stratum i, respectively.  In particular, the model assumes that the coefficients for explanatory covariates Z (denoted by beta) are the same for all strata i. \n\nIn the likelihood optimization, u_i=log(lambda_i) and v_i=log(gamma_i) are used as parameters to remove the parameters' range constriction. The likelihood function is optimized using optim() function. The maximum likelihood estimates are used to estimate baseline hazard ratios between two subjects (see \\code{\\link{HRatio}}), and survival function (see \\code{\\link{plot.icweib}}).\n\nThis function can accommondate different types of censored time-to-event outcomes: left censoring, right censoring, interval censoring, and non-censoring (event), by appropriately setting L and R,\n\n\\tabular{lll}{\n\t L     \\tab R     \\tab INTERPRETATION \\cr\n\t \\cr\n\t a   \\tab b   \\tab interval censoring, [a, b] \\cr\n\t 0   \\tab b   \\tab left censoring, [0, b] \\cr\n\t a   \\tab Inf \\tab right censoring, [a, Inf] \\cr\n\t a   \\tab a   \\tab no censoring, event time = a \\cr\n  } \n\n}\n\\value{\nThis function returns an object with class \\emph{icweib}.
